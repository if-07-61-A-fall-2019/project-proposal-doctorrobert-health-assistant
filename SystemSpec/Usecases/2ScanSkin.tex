    \subsubsection{UI to call the use case}
        
        There are two ways a user can open our skin scan feature:
        
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item The user opens our app with the intent to check their skin and starts the process of getting a diagnosis by clicking on the menu icon and selecting the camera icon to start taking a picture and submitting it.

        \item The user has already entered their somewhat skin related symptoms, so to make the diagnosis more accurate Doctor Robert suggests to try our skin scan feature and provides an option to open it right from the dialog.

    \subsubsection{The Standard Use}
        
        Depending on how the use case was called the happy path differs a bit, but is essentially the same:
